Welcome to Course Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course from Coursera.

The objective for this repository is to contain the results to the project of this course, with a script to transform collected data to compreensive informations.

There are three files: 
- README.md: this file.
- CodeBook.md: info about the processed data.
- run_analysis.R: script in R to process data.

The run_analysis.R works by this way:
- read train data set
- read test data set
- merge data
- process data, extracting mean and standard deviation 
- save results
